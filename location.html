            <h3>Where is the wedding?</h3>
            <p>We are getting married at Kincaid Chalet at the Kincaid Outdoor Center at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kincaid+Outdoor+Center/@61.1538996,-150.0553148,17.44z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x56c8a2f23db61831:0xa679632e4684d8d3!2sKincaid+Outdoor+Center!8m2!3d61.1544745!4d-150.0422915!3m4!1s0x56c8a2f0b934454b:0x3e3366675da6033b!8m2!3d61.1540738!4d-150.0551098">9401 Raspberry Rd, Anchorage, AK 99502</a>. (Which is the same place that we met back in 2017!) It's about 15 minutes from the Anchorage airport and 20 minutes from downtown. Below is a google map that points out the venue and places to stay in the area. </p>

            <h3>What time should I get there?</h3>
            <p>The ceremony starts at 2:30 p.m., so we recommend arriving by at least 2:15 so you can find your seats.</p> 

            <h3>What is the general schedule of the ceremony and reception?</h3> 
            <p>The ceremony will last until about 3:00 p.m., with a “cocktail hour” following while the wedding party takes photos. The reception will go from about 4:00 p.m. until around 9:00 p.m.</p> 

            <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
            <p>It’s Alaska...so wear something comfortable that you also wouldn’t be embarrassed to be photographed in.</p>

            <h3>Will the wedding be inside or outside?</h3>
            <p>This may help you decide what to wear! The ceremony is outside, but under a large picnic shelter. The reception is inside the Kincaid Chalet.</p> 

            <h3>What will the weather be like at this time of year?</h3>
            <p>That is a great question! The summer weather in Anchorage, Alaska can vary dramatically. It could be 60 degrees and raining, 75 degrees and sunny or anywhere in between. If you’re coming from out of state, pack options and layers. In case it’s chilly, you’ll want to bring a jacket.</p> 

            <h3>Where are you registered?</h3>
            <p>We have a registry set up on Amazon that we had a lot of fun picking things for, and a fund set up through Zola. However, please don’t feel like you have to get us something if you come to our wedding...we just want to celebrate with you!</p>

            <h3>Will there be food and drinks at the reception?</h3>
            <p>Of course! We will have snacks at the cocktail hour and dinner following, catered by Peppercini’s. We will also have a selection of beer, wine and other assorted wine coolers and cider. Unfortunately, the venue does not allow us to bring hard alcohol. If you have a preference for drinks, please let us know in the RSVP form!</p>

            <h3>What if I have dietary restrictions?</h3>
            <p>There is an option to put any dietary restrictions you have on the RSVP. Please tell us who in your party has the restriction and what it is, and we can accommodate!</p>

            <h3>When should I RSVP?</h3> 
            <p>Please fill out the RSVP form on this site by May 20, 2020, even if you can’t make it! That was we don’t have to track you down to make sure. Although, the earlier you let us know if you can make it, the better. If you don’t want to fill out the form online, please contact Grace or Levi to let them know if you can make it.</p> 

            <h3>Can I bring a guest?</h3>
            <p>Yes! We accounted for guests and/or dates when making up our invite list. Please don’t go overboard (the venue only had so many chairs!) but if you want to bring a significant other or close friend, please just add them to your guest count when filling out the RSVP form. (Please only fill out one RSVP form per invitation.) If the number in your party changes between when you RSVP and the day of the wedding just contact Grace or Levi and let them know.</p>

            <h3>Can I take photos and post them on social media?</h3>
            <p>Yes please! We want to see all your photos! Please use the hashtag #BecomingABarsis so we can see all the amazing pictures from our big day.</p> 

            <h3>If I still have questions, can I contact you?</h3>
            <p>Please! Just call, text, email, Facebook message or send either one of us a note by owl.</p>
